        <p>Floating here like this with you<br />
          Underneath the stars<br />
          Alight for 13 billion years<br />
          The view is beautiful<br />
          And ours alone tonight<br />
          Underneath the stars</p>
        <p>Spinning round and round with you<br />
          Watching shadows melt the light<br />
          Soft shining from our eyes<br />
          Into another space<br />
          Is ours alone tonight<br />
          Watching shadows melt</p>
        <p>And the waves break...<br />
          And the waves break...</p>
        <p>Whisper in my ear a wish<br />
          &quot;We could drift away&quot;<br />
          Held tight<br />
          Your voice inside my head<br />
          The kiss is infinite<br />
          And ours alone tonight<br />
          &quot;We could drift away&quot;</p>
        <p>Flying here like this with you<br />
          Underneath the stars<br />
          Alight for 13 billion years<br />
          The view is beautiful<br />
          And ours alone tonight<br />
          Underneath the stars</p>
        <p>And everything gone<br />
          And all still to come<br />
          As nothing to us<br />
          Together as one<br />
          In each others arms<br />
          So near and so far<br />
          Forever as now<br />
          Underneath the stars</p>
        <p>As the waves break...</p>

        <p>Oh I love, Oh I love, Oh I love<br />
          What you do to my head<br />
          When you pull me upstairs<br />
          And you push me to bed<br />
          Oh I love what you do to my head<br />
          It’s a mess up there!</p>
        <p>Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love<br />

          Oh I love what you do to my heart<br />
          It’s the best, oh yeah!</p>

          When you suck me inside<br />
          And you blow me a kiss<br />
          Oh I love what you do to my lips<br />
          It’s so sweet in there</p>
        <p>Oh I love, love, love, love<br />
          What you do to my hips<br />
          When you blow me outside<br />
          And then suck me like this<br />
          Oh I love what you do to my hips<br />
          It’s the beat, oh yeah!</p>
        <p>You’re the only one I cry for<br />

          You’re the only one I sigh for<br />
          The only one I die to squeeze</p>
        <p>And it gets better every day, I play<br />
          With you it’s such a scream<br />
          Yeah it gets meta every day, I say<br />
          With you it’s so extreme<br />
          Yeah it gets wetter every day I stay<br />
          With you it’s like a dream</p>
        <p>Oh I love, Oh I love, Oh I love<br />
          What you do to my skin<br />

          And slide me in<br />
          Oh I love what you do to my skin<br />
          It’s a blush on there</p>

        <p>I won't try to bring you down about my suicide<br />
          Got no need to understand about my big surprise<br />
          I won't beg to hang you up about my love of life<br />
          If you promise not to sing about the reasons why</p>
        <p>I am writing you a letter<br />
          Getting better<br />
          Can I see you?<br />
          When...<br />
          All the lights go out together<br />
          Blame the weather<br />
          Yeah the cold again<br />
          In the darkness for a second<br />
          I am sure I see them smiling then<br />
          I feel them calling me<br />
          Yeah they are calling me...</p>
        <p>And I am falling through the stars<br />
          You remember now?<br />
          Yeah I am falling in their arms<br />
          You remember how?<br />
          Oh I am falling through the sky<br />
          You remember this ?<br />
          I am falling in their eyes<br />
          You remember the kiss?</p>
        <p>I won't try to pull you in about my sacrifice<br />
          Makes no sense to get upset about the other side<br />
          I won't beg to put you out about my right to die<br />
          If you promise not to sing about the reasons why</p>
        <p>I am calling you at midnight<br />
          Feeling alright...can I tell you?<br />
          When?<br />
          On the line no sound but my words<br />
          Must be night birds on the wire again<br />
          In the silence for a second<br />
          I am sure I hear them laughing then<br />
          I feel them calling me<br />
          Yeah they are calling me...</p>
        <p>I am falling through the stars<br />
          You remember now<br />
          Yeah, I am falling in their arms<br />
          You remember how<br />
          I am falling through the sky<br />
          You remember this<br />
          I am falling in their eyes<br />
          You remember the kiss</p>
        <p>&quot;We know&quot;<br />
          They said<br />
          &quot;You're holding on<br />
          To nothing left of something gone&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;We know&quot;<br />
          They said<br />
          &quot;In letting go<br />
          Of fear and dread<br />
          And all you know<br />
          You'll lose the need of certainty<br />
          And make-believe eternity<br />
          To find the true reality<br />
          In beautiful infinity....&quot;</p>
        <p>But I won't try to bring you down about my suicide<br />

          I must be dreaming<br />
          She turns the sound down<br />
          Says &quot;I am heaving<br />
          This is a freakshow&quot;<br />
          and I am screaming<br />
          She spins the world round<br />
          I want to stop</p>
        <p>Bittersweet again<br />
          Her opening move<br />
          Down and out in black<br />
          Soft shiny and smooth<br />
          Looks like the alien crowd got groove<br />
          She burns her name into my arm<br />
          but I can never get through</p>
        <p>To play the game she's trying to lose<br />
          Her ultraviolet makes it harder to choose<br />
          Looks like the edge of the earth got moved<br />
          She blurs a way across the floor<br />
          I spin to swallow the view</p>
        <p>And it's the same sway<br />
          yeah it's the same slide<br />
          It's the same stare<br />
          Oh it's the same smile<br />
          Yeah it's the same but...<br />
          it's not quite right</p>
        <p>Oh it's insane<br />
          She shakes like a freak<br />
          Stuck in the middle of the room for a week<br />
          Looks like the only way to get on the beat<br />
          Is take her up on how to swing<br />
          But I am missing my feet</p>
        <p>And it's the same sway<br />
          Yeah it's the same slide<br />
          It's the same swish<br />
          Oh it's the same smile<br />
          Yeah it's the same but...<br />
          It's not quite right</p>
        <p>I'm in a step...out!<br />
          She two more steps...down!<br />
          For three steps up...clap!<br />
          And go around...ow!<br />
          It makes my head buzz<br />
          She wants to come now<br />
          I try to stop</p>
        <p>Always infradig her finishing move<br />
          Up and down in black<br />
          Soft shiny and smooth<br />
          Looks like the alien crowd got groove<br />
          She cuts a number out my arm<br />

        <p>To play this game she's trying to lose<br />
          The stuff from Mars makes it harder to choose<br />
          Looks like the final frontier got moved<br />

          I spin to swallow the view</p>

        <p>It could have been her golden hair<br />
          That turned my head<br />
          I didn't look to stare<br />
          Like I was hypnotized<br />
          But I was fixed<br />
          On how she pointed slowly down<br />
          And low I sank<br />
          And still without a sound<br />
          The world was far away<br />
          And I was tricked</p>
        <p>It could have been her silver skin<br />
          That drew me on<br />
          I didn't mean to spin<br />
          Like I was mesmerised<br />
          But I was rapt<br />
          Without a name or memory<br />
          I waited there<br />
          Too scared to even breathe...</p>
        <p>She sang...she sang...she sang...</p>

          &quot;Tell me you love me<br />

          &quot;Give me your life<br />
          Or I must fly away<br />
          And you will never hear this song again&quot;</p>
        <p>It could have been her crystal eyes<br />
          That made me stop<br />
          I didn't want to sigh<br />
          Like I was stupefied<br />
          But I was thrown<br />
          And at that point of no return<br />
          My whole life hanging<br />
          On a single word<br />
          To be hers evermore<br />
          Or mine alone</p>
        <p>She sang...she sang...she sang...<br />

          But it was all I had to wear<br />
          Give me what I need<br />
          Please share<br />
          You know it's only right<br />
          And I would never lie to you<br />
          I wouldn't dare...</p>
        <p>I made a promise to myself<br />
          I wouldn't start with anyone else but...<br />
          You know how it is with these promises<br />
          Made in the heat of the moment<br />
          They're made to be broken in two<br />
          Sometimes the only thing to do</p>
        <p>Oh no!<br />
          It's all coming back<br />
          How I came to in a sticky 3 day hole<br />
          Didn't see the sign<br />
          Go Slow<br />
          Too busy tuning static on the radio<br />
          She hissed it in a song<br />
          &quot;Don't go...<br />
          it always fades to black&quot;<br />
          But that's why I love the trip, it's so inevitable<br />
          I made a promise to myself<br />
          I wouldn't fall for anyone else but...<br />
          You know how it is with these promises<br />
          Made in the heat of the moment<br />
          They're made to be less than they seem<br />
          Whenever you've got what I need</p>
        <p>And you've got what I need...<br />
          You've got what I need<br />
          You've got what I need</p>
        <p>AAAIIIIEEE!<br />
          For service with a smile<br />
          I have to walk in on my hands<br />
          and roll for free<br />
          You say it's all the same<br />
          Ennui...<br />
          You're not the real Snow White<br />
          The real Snow White is on my knee<br />
          I didn't need to get<br />
          ID<br />
          It's simply minimum height<br />
          And getting all dressed up<br />
          In seven ways to please<br />
          Yeah</p>
        <p>I made a promise to myself<br />
          I wouldn't stay with anyone else but...<br />
          You know how it is with these promises<br />
          Made in the heat of the moment<br />
          They're made to be broken one day<br />
          If there's no time to get away</p>
        <p>Uh oh!<br />
          She wasn't made to shine<br />
          She was really only ever made to glow<br />
          I left her in the dark<br />
          No show<br />
          Quiet sucking on a line<br />
          It was a tricky gun to load<br />
          And I didn't get to fire<br />
          Hi-Ho!<br />
          She's off to work for time<br />
          And I should have finished out with higher<br />
          Up than low</p>
        <p>Yeah, I made a promise to myself<br />
          I wouldn't stop with anyone else but...<br />
          You know how it is with these promises<br />
          Made in the heat of the moment<br />
          They're made befor right becomes wrong<br />
          Whenever you've got what I want<br />
          Whenever you've got what I want<br />
          Whenever you've got what I want<br />
          Whenever you've got what I want</p>
        <p>And you've got what I want<br />
          You've got what I want<br />
          You've got what I want</p>
        <p>Oh yeah!<br />
          It's only for the night<br />
          And I will give it back tomorrow<br />
          I swear</p>

          Measure time in leisure time and greed<br />
          And by the time we get to spend<br />
          A floating bed<br />
          A head of stone<br />

          Dream a world maybe no one owns<br />
          No don't think about all the life we miss<br />

          Turned into somebody else<br />
          Full of wishes want dreams<br />
          And desires<br />
          For a life<br />
          Of conceit and deceit<br />

          But until then...&quot;</p>
        <p>They told me I would live forever<br />
          If I kept it clean<br />
          They said I would be the chosen one<br />
          If I took one for the team<br />
          Yeah it's the only way to be<br />
          Never think it isn't fair<br />
          That's a green-eyed panic climb<br />
          To the edge of nowhere</p>
        <p>Give it to the chicken<br />
          And see if it ticks<br />
          Yeah, give it to the kitten<br />
          See if it sicks<br />
          Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me<br />
          And I will tell on my return the way it is<br />
          with all the happy boys and girls</p>
        <p>Yeah the whole h-h-happy world<br />
          And the love they feel for me<br />
          Yeah the love they feel for me</p>
        <p>&quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead&quot;, I said<br />
          &quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead&quot;, I said</p>
        <p>They told me I could run the world<br />
          If I kept it quiet<br />
          They said I could be the man<br />
          If I took it out of sight<br />
          In a monkey suit again<br />
          Having fun with all your friends<br />
          How a casual hour can pull<br />
          All this world to pieces</p>
        <p>Give it to the bunny<br />
          And see if she kicks<br />
          Yeah, give it to the puppy<br />
          And see if he sticks<br />
          Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me<br />
          I'll let you know when I get back, just how it is<br />
          with all the other boys and girls</p>
        <p>Yeah the whole f...f... other world<br />
          And the way it stirs inside<br />
          And the why it never burns at night<br />
          And the way they make the climb<br />
          And the why they never pray for time<br />
          And the way I show surprise<br />
          And the why I never close my eyes<br />
          Yeah, just how it is</p>
        <p>&quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead&quot;, I said<br />
          &quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead&quot;, I said<br />
          &quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead&quot;, I said<br />
          &quot;Sleep when I'm dead, you angels<br />
          I'll sleep when I'm dead<br />
          But until then...&quot;</p>
        <p>Well...I should at least feel tired, I think<br />
          Before I lay me down to dream </p>

        <p>Yeah I've been this way before<br />
          But something down here changed<br />
          The Spring sun hanging slower<br />
          Colder in the sky<br />
          And your voice sounds strange<br />
          Your voice sounds strange</p>
        <p>Yeah I've been down here before<br />
          But this time<br />
          Something really isn't right<br />
          Summer sun hangs smaller<br />
          Paler in the sky<br />
          And your eyes are too bright<br />
          Your eyes are too bright</p>
        <p>It's like everything I know<br />
          Is twisted out and wrong<br />
          The Fall sun hanging flatter<br />
          Lower in the sky<br />
          And your smile is gone<br />
          Your smile is gone</p>
        <p>It's like twisted out I know<br />
          Now I can't wake to<br />
          Break apart this dream<br />
          Winter sun hangs weaker<br />
          Older in the sky<br />
          And you start to scream<br />
          You start to scream</p>
        <p>You start to scream...</p>
        <p>Scream and you scream<br />
          This is not a dream<br />
          This is how it really is<br />
          There isn't any other this<br />
          Is not a dream</p>
        <p>Scream and you scream<br />
          Why you have this need<br />
          Why you can't be satisfied<br />
          Always want another why<br />
          You have this need</p>
        <p>Scream and you scream<br />
          Dare me to believe<br />
          Dare me now to show I care<br />
          One last chance to make the dare<br />
          Me to believe</p>
        <p>Scream and you scream<br />
          How we ended here<br />
          How we got from then to now<br />
          Never really followed how<br />
          We ended here</p>

        <p>I get up<br />
          And it's over<br />
          It's always over<br />
          It's raining and I'm burned<br />
          And it's late and you're gone<br />
          And I can barely remember<br />
          Anything I did or said<br />
          Or how I lost another week<br />
          There must be something going on...</p>
        <p>A nagging sense of shame<br />
          I can't explain<br />
          An acrid taste of smoke and blood<br />
          And tears and drugs<br />
          And every inch of me is raw<br />
          And it's always fucking over<br />
          It's raining and I'm blind<br />
          And it's late and you're gone<br />
          I can't do this anymore</p>
        <p>Keep getting there<br />
          It's over<br />
          It's always over<br />
          It's raining and I'm cracked<br />
          And it's late and you're out<br />
          And I can't quite remember<br />
          Anything I did or said<br />
          Or how I lost another year<br />
          There must be something coming down...</p>
        <p>A sweetly sour unease<br />
          It's like a tease<br />
          A broken dream of guilt and fear<br />
          And spit and steel<br />
          And every piece of me in pain<br />
          And it's always fucking over<br />
          It's raining and it's cold<br />
          And it's late and you're out again</p>
        <p>Run my head around it<br />
          Like I know I really miss her<br />
          &quot;But I always want to do it now&quot;<br />
          She told me in a whisper<br />
          I try so hard to place it<br />
          Wonder why I really feel it<br />
          When to send the pretty flowers<br />
          Maybe helps her to believe it</p>
        <p>Run my tongue along it<br />
          Oh the taste is something sicker<br />
          &quot;But you know you have to do it now&quot;<br />
          She told me in a whisper<br />
          It only takes a second<br />
          But the second lasts forever<br />
          &quot;Close your eyes<br />
          And let me take you down...&quot;</p>
        <p>And I get up<br />
          And it's over<br />
          It's always fucking over<br />
          It's raining and I'm wrecked<br />
          And it's late and you're...</p>
        <p>No I can't remember<br />
          Anything I did or said<br />
          Or how I lost another life<br />
          I lost another life<br />
          I lost another life<br />
          I lost another life</p>
