            <p>Say 
              it's the same sun spinning in the same sky<br />
              Say it's the same stars streaming in the same night<br />
              Tell me it's the same world whirling through the same space<br />
              Tell me it's the same time tripping through the same day<br />
              So say it's the same house and nothing in the house is changed<br />
              Yeah say it's the same room and nothing in the room is strange<br />
              Oh tell me it's the same boy burning in the same bed<br />
              Tell me it's the same blood breaking in the same head </p>
            <p> Say it's the same taste taking down the same kiss<br />
              Say it's the same you<br />
              Say it's the same you and it's always been like this<br />
              Say it's the same you<br />
              Say it's the same you and it always and forever is<br />

            <p> Yeah tell me it's all the same<br />
              This is how it's always been<br />

            <p> But the sun is cold - the sky is wrong<br />
              The stars are black - the night is gone<br />
              The world is still - the space is stopped<br />
              The time is out - the day is dropped<br />
              The house is dark - the room is scarred<br />
              The boy is stiff - the bed is hard<br />
              The blood is thick - the head is burst<br />
              The taste is dry - the kiss is thirst </p>
            <p> And it's not the same you<br />
              It's not the same you </p>
            <p> No it never was like this<br />
              It's not the same you<br />
              It's not the same you and it never really is<br />

              Hanging for a world too beautiful...</p>
            <p>Wishing for 
              a girl too true<br />
              Hoping for a girl too good<br />
              Hungry for a girl too beautiful...<br />
              &quot;All I say is a lie&quot; she sighs<br />
              &quot;Nothing I say is true<br />
              And all I do is bad&quot; she cries<br />
              &quot;Nothing I do is good<br />
              And yeah all I am is ugly<br />
              Nothing I am is beautiful at all...<br />
              I don't get 
              this world&quot;<br />
              I don't get this girl...</p>
            <p>&quot;So look... and 
              you won't see it<br />
              Listen... and you won't hear it<br />
              Reach out... and you won't hold it...<br />
              You can't know it, but you can free it<br />
              You can't name it<br />
              But you can be  it...&quot;</p>
            <p>I've been 
              waiting for the lies to end<br />
              Holding for the bad to go<br />
              I've been hanging for the ugliness to change<br />
              Waiting for a world too true<br />
              Holding for a world too good<br />
              Hanging for a world too beautiful...</p>
            <p>Wishing for 
              a girl...like you<br />
              Hoping for a girl...like you<br />
              Hungry for a girl...like you<br />
              No...not &quot;like&quot; you...<br />

              I never meant to let you go </p>
            <p> There was a moment<br />

              You turn in pain<br />
              And I always let you go<br />

              Below this same remembering sky<br />
              I kissed you<br />
              You never wanted me to know...<br />

              And months just fly... <br />
              we didn't ever really touch at all <br />
              Weeks always run down... <br />

              So mean and so white<br />
              I stare at her in this room<br />

            <p>In

              In his eyes as we turned... no infinity of why<br />
              In his eyes as we turned... no beautiful goodbye<br />
              In his eyes as we turned... nothing but tears...<br />
              In his eyes as we turned... nothing but tears...</p>
            <p>The dawn call was broken, short,<br />

              A matter of minutes, peacefully, so sorry...<br />
              I had to think to breathe, <br />
              my heart bursting in my head...<br />
              We moved in silence through <br />
              a slowly walking world of pale grey rain...<br />
              And as we drove, a strange sun spilt the sky...<br />
              In that moment I knew <br />
              nothing would ever be the same again...<br />
              The days
