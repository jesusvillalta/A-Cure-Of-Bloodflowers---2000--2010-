                And I don't know where I am...<br>
                Should he beg her to forgive?<br>
                So happy and so young...<br>
                And I stare...<br>
                As I live out the story of a stranger in love<br>
                Waking up going on<br>
                In the other world that spins around undone<br>
                And I don't know where I am...<br>

                Say it's the same stars streaming in the same night<br>
                Tell me it's the same world whirling through the same space<br>
                Tell me it's the same time tripping through the same day<br>
                So say it's the same house and nothing in the house has changed<br>
                Yeah say it's the same room and nothing in the room is strange<br>
                Oh tell me it's the same boy burning in the same bed<br>

                This is how it's always been<br>
                But if nothing has changed...<br>
                Then it must mean...<br>
                But the sun is cold - the sky is wrong<br>
                The stars are black - the night is gone<br>
                The world is still - the space is stopped<br>
                The time is out - the day is dropped<br>
                The house is dark - the room is scarred<br>
                The boy is stiff - the bed is hard<br>
                The blood is thick - the head is burst<br>
                The taste is dry - the kiss is thirst<br>
                And it's not the same you<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                No it never was like this<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                It's not the same you and it never really is<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                No it never was like this<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                It's not the same you and it never really is<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                It's not the same you<br>
                Oh it's not the same<br>
                This isn't how it's always been<br>

                You never wanted me to know...<br>
                Another year ago tonight<br>
                Behind this same remembering sky<br>
                I kissed you...<br>
                I never meant to let you go<br>
                Another moment<br>
                There always is<br>
                As time stands still<br>
                and always is this...<br>
                One endless moment<br>
                You tell me all<br>
                And I hold you and I kiss you<br>
                And I never let you go<br>
                I never let you go... </font></p>

                And time will heal<br>
                You promised me..<br>
                How love will save<br>
                Make me forget<br>
                You promised me<br>
                Love will save<br>
                Make me forget<br>
                You promised me<br>
                Time will heal us all<br>
                And love will save<br>
                You promised me...<br>
                I trusted you<br>
                I wanted your words<br>
                Believed in you<br>
                I needed your words<br>
                Time will heal<br>
                make me forget<br>
                And love will save us all<br>
                You promised me another wish<br>
                Another way<br>
                You promised me another dream<br>
                Another day<br>
                You proised me another time<br>
                You promised me another life<br>
                You promised me..<br>
                So I swallowed the shame and I waited<br>
                I buried the blame and I waited<br>
                Choked back years o memories...<br>
                I pushed down the pain and I waited<br>
                Trying to forget...<br>
                You promised me another wish<br>
                Another way<br>
                You promised me another dream<br>
                Another day<br>
                You proised me another time<br>
                You promised me...<br>
                Another lie<br>
                Oh you promised me... You promised me... You promised me...<br>
                And I waited... And I waited... And I waited...<br>
                And I'm still waiting... </font></p>
